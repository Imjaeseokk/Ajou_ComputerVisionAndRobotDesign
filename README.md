### 👋 Introduction

This project presents a gesture-based control system for service robots, utilizing TurtleBot3 and Mediapipe for hand gesture recognition. By combining Detectron2 for object segmentation and real-time hand skeleton tracking, the system identifies user-pointed objects and enables the robot to navigate and interact with them. Experimental results show high accuracy, with gesture classification at 98.83% and Mask R-CNN at 96.58%, demonstrating the system's potential to improve human-robot interaction through advanced vision-based technologies.
